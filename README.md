# SpaceXplorer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zaffranad/spacex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zaffranad/spacex)

This project is a light application displaying SpaceX data retrieved from the awesome REST API from the awesome business SpaceX.

To be honest, this is almost my first Angular 2+ app and the main purpose of this project was to play with Angular/Html/Scss, as you may see if you look into the git log history... 

## SpaceX REST API

SpaceX gave us new rockets, new horizons and a new API offering tons of data about past launches, rockets, and more!

Check here: [SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) 

## Run and Watch!

While you're at the root of the repository:

`npm run serve`

This will start the application on port 4200 (default)... or run the following to use a different port:

`ng serve --watch --open`

## Wanna deploy?

Having fun with this app, if you want to build and deploy:

`ng build --prod`

## Continuous Integration

A automated build is configured on Travis CI (hey, look the nice badge at the top of this page!).

The configuration is located in the travis.yml file at the root of the project.
